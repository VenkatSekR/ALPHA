In the previous tutorial we saw that IF ELSE condition gives us the 
provision of executing statements not only when the condition is 
evaluated to be true but also when the condition is evaluated to be false. 
But using IF ELSE statement we can only check one condition at a time, 
there is no provision for checking multiple conditions. This becomes 
its major drawback.

To overcome this we have IF THEN ELSIF condition in Oracle PL/SQL. 
Using this statement you can check multiple conditions unlike the 
IF conditions discussed in the previous tutorials.
