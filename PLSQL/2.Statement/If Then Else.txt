The previous tutorial was all about IF-THEN statement in Oracle PL/SQL. 
There we learnt that a simple IF-THEN statement enables us to specify the 
sequence of statements to be executed only if the condition is evaluated to 
be true. In case this condition is evaluated to be false then no special 
action is to be taken except to proceed with execution of the program.

To overcome this drawback in oracle PL/SQL we have IF-THEN-ELSE statement 
widely pronounced as IF-ELSE statement.

With IF-THEN-ELSE in PL/SQL we have two groups of executable statements, 
one which gets executed if the condition is evaluated to be true and another 
group gets executed if the condition is evaluated to be false. Once the 
IF-THEN-ELSE construct gets completed the next statement right after 
IF-THEN-ELSE block is executed.
